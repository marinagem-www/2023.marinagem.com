Sunset is part of the RGB series, in which RED, GREEN and BLUE are seen as the primary colours of the present; the chromatic basis of our screen-mediated relationships with the world.

Each of the colours is symbolically associated with a natural element essential to life on earth, combining a painted wall with artificial light.

In Sunset (RED), the geometries create a sunset and its reflections on the water. A red sun burning in pollution and an arid environment where the sun's reflection on the water is directly on a dry ground.
