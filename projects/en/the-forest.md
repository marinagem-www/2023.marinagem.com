This project references our understanding of vegetative landscapes and the construction and dissemination of digital images. Contemporary humans perceive the environment with an utilitarian perspective, in a desire to control nature. From cinematic technologies to digital development, we are able to recreate landscapes illusions while destroying the environment, without taking in consideration these landscapes as a live ecosystem.
