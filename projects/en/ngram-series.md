Data visualisation paintings that transform the frequency of words found in books (in the 20th century), mapped by Google Ngram Viewer, into graphic mountains that unfold into earth-transforming critical short contemporary narratives.

Each word is assigned a colour, the first word is the first graphic line, and so on. Always from right to left and from bottom to top. In a Cartesian plan, the X-axis starts at the year of 1920 and ends in 2020, while the Y-axis is the percentage of occurrence of the words that named the work.
