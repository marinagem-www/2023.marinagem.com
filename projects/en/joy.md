Each frame of this work is composed of an acrylic box mirror, containing approximately 10,000 fake crystals and includes a sticker written “felicity”, commonly used in gift packaging in Brazil, wishing joy to the receiver. The brightness of the crystals associated with the word generates prompt contentment, and instant satisfaction to the viewer.

The use of artificial crystals looks at the fake value of things, which is given by the representation of something, not the thing itself. It is influenced by Aristotle's theory of happiness, linked to the idea of satisfaction. This project is part of a bigger research that approaches various concepts of happiness in contemporaneity.
