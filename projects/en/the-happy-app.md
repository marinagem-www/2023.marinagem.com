The Happy App is an application that simultaneously triggers the computer camera and records a "screen shot" every minute. The images provided by the camera (usually the user's face) are analyzed using emotion recognition technology that quantifies the basic emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust and anger) through micro facial expressions. Thus, a relationship of the user's emotions is made according to the content he is seeing on the computer.

For the first exhibition I spent 8 hours in front of the computer executing ordinary activities (email, Facebook, payments, shopping, Netflix, Skype) and got the result of my emotions during that day. In 405 minutes online I was only 6% happy. Developed in partnership with [Thiago Hersan](https://thiagohersan.com){:target="_blank"}.
