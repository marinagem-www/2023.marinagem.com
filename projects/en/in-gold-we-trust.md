“In Gold We Trust” is a series of 25 drawings inspired by the gold hunt in the Brazilian mountains, produced during a residence from which a view to the sierra could be seen, in Itabirito, Minas Gerais.The title of the work is a pun containing the same phrase as seen on the US dollar: "In God in Trust".

This project looked at the tense social and economic values intrinsic to the relationship between the history of gold exploration and its ballast and the belief in current economic systems, despite its instability.
