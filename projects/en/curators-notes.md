Curator’s Notes is a machine-assisted, emotion-driven “graphical landscape” about the process of acting as an artist-curator during the Virus-19 online residency. Along a cycle of stream mentorship sessions through “Zoom”, a specific version of the [Happy App](../the-happy-app/) was activated to measure the mental states of curator and artists throughout video calls.

The 2D white lines correspond to the artists' levels of happiness throughout the duration of the call. The 3D images correspond to variations of the curator's emotions with an applied texture linked to a material used by the artist in their work.

This work was a digital site-specific for the online degenerative publication of the [Virus-19 Residency](https://res19encia.github.io/en/){:target="_blank"}. In partnership with [Thiago Hersan](https://thiagohersan.com){:target="_blank"}.
