Curator's Notes is a machine-assisted, emotion-driven "graphical landscape" about the process of acting as an artist-curator during the [Virus-19 Online Residency](https://virus19.ml/en/){:target="_blank"}. Along a cycle of stream mentorship sessions through "Zoom", the Happy App (ongoing project) was activated to measure curator and artists mental states throughout video calls. None of the artists were aware of their monitoring.

This work is a digital site-specific for the online degenerative publication of the [Virus-19 Residency](https://virus19.ml/en/){:target="_blank"}. In partnership with [Thiago Hersan](https://thiagohersan.com){:target="_blank"}.
