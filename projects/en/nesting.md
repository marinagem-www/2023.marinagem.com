Nesting is a series inspired by the different types of internal structures of birds' nests and their mechanisms for protecting eggs. 

The sculptures use clay as the primary medium, first treating it as a 2D surface similar to paper, then transforming it into closed objects that are folded to hold an element - a mineral, a plant, a magnet - creating another nest. 

The paintings are based on sectional drawings of birds' nests and the formal strategies they use to protect their eggs. Here , theyâ€™re overlayed, becoming cellular structures in constant motion. 

Through the juxtaposition of macro and micro perspectives, and the transition from two-dimensional painting to three-dimensional sculpture, this series invites the viewer to consider the intricate relationships between life forms and their habitats.
