Cordiais is an online database that correlates historical paintings that depict Brazilian women with the results of a facial recognition algorithm that measures these characters’ happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear. This quantitative data is transformed into rectangles whose areas represent the amount of each emotion relative to the size of the original work, leading to a form of color-blocks abstract paintings-data-visualization. This irreverent process responds to the desire of rendering the digital body and the underlying mechanisms of power and representation, inherent to late surveillance capitalism, in more tangible forms.
