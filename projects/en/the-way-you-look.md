Two points of view of the same landscape projected one in front of the other.

Sound: phrases extracted from the Godard and Miéville TV series “France/tour/detour/deux/enfants” from 1977:

\- Do you think we designed the streets for us to be lost or for us to be found?  
\- And the light, it moves in a straight line or curve line?  
\- Sometimes straight-line, sometimes curve line.  
\- And the image, it also has an existence?  
\- Yes.  
\- So, it is like you have 2 lives (existences)?  
\- Maybe.
