This video is a satire of a fictitious water ski resort in the Amazon forest in Brazil. Image processing resembles photography produced by a thermal camera; heat is intensified, like the colors, the water turns into fire. The text is a mix of typical expressions of the northern region of the country and publicity slogans. The soundtrack, inserted in very specific moments, brings fragments of mixed Brazilian songs and samplers commonly used in "Aparelhagens", the electronic parties of the state of Par√°.
