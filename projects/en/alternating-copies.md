From the video Am√©nager made at the worksite in Plainpalais square, this second work was shown on the opening day of the plaza. Sixteen copies of the video were disposed in 4 monitors (each screen was also divided in 4). The videos were shown simultaneously with temporal delays. Every video is different, each one has the name of a worker who was present during the first day of shooting. All workers received a DVD with their own "customized copy" at the end of the project.
