During the residence at Casa das Caldeiras, two works were developed. _Lifespan_ and _The Locomotion_. _The Locomotion_ was shot with a set of mirrors giving to the architecture of the place another perspective. As a site-specific, the video is projected where it was filmed, creating imaginative rails emphasized by the metallic sound.
