A digital filter can make every circumstance extremely attractive. This installation uses a physical filter to represent the way we tend to look to others events as more desirable, we are never satisfying. On the windows, the green filter makes the outside always greener, in allusion to the expression “the grass is always greener in the other side of the fence”.
