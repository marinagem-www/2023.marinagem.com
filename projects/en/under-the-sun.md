Humans have always used the sun and other stars as navigational tools, not only for practical purposes, but also for political, metaphysical and cosmological guidance. Days and nights were seen as opposites until we reached modernity, when the logics of industrialization started reshaping crucial aspects of social behavior and economic progress. Even though we are still somewhat guided by the sun, we are constantly having our circadian rhythms reprogrammed while living in a metropolis. This is an ongoing research to re-interpret the power and time of solar cycles in the digital era.
