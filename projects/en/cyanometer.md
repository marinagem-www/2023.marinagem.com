The "Cyanometer" is an object created in 1789 to measure the sky color intensity. It consists of a paper circle dyed in various shades of blue. In this digital collage, a sky was photographed each hour, always in the same point of view. The photos are disposed in a chronological order.

In the accompanying video, sea and sky merge naturally in the absence of a horizon forming a blue gradation. The excavator with its inverse movement seems to deconstruct and built the beach at the same time. This effect brings a delicate twist to the small actions involved in the video, creating a landscape that merges the artificial.
