"Essence of a virtual soul" emerged amid an 8-hour performance in front of the computer for the first work done through the Happy App. What if the virtual world (a combination of algorithms) has its own emotions, feelings, therefore a soul ? The reflecting cote applied creates the illusion that the light is moving, in a way to give life to inanimate objects inside a screen, marked with black paint on the wall.
