Infinitum was developed during the ComCiÃªncia residency, from the Museum of Mines and Metals in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in partnership with [Thiago Hersan](https://thiagohersan.com/){:target="_blank"}. Using archival images of the museum, this infinite scroll draws a link between our insatiable consumption of social media and the anthropocentric perspective which treats terrestrial resources as infinite.

Given the large number of images in the archive, we used different algorithms to automate cropping, detection of dominant colors and sorting of the images. A dimensionality reduction algorithm was used to sort the images based on different color parameters (hue, brightness, redness, etc), creating a very large number of possible orderings for the images.
