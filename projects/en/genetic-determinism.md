Science seeks natural explanations for observable phenomena. In this work, I act as a scientist of the digital image, observing it and creating concepts based in evolutionary theories. What this image reveals beyond an organization of pixels? Behind a stone placed in a colored background, may this object have other meaning?

Genetic Determinism in a term where the genes determine shape and biological function of a being. What are the genes of this image? How these genes can define an object, beyond its digital structure? How is the organization of these elements? How would a stone would be if its genes were birds?

In this video, a zoom out proposes a transcendence: birds are the fundamental structures of a rock. The sequence of images shows a possibility of body, of substance, fully justifiable if we analyze the digital image not as a representation of something, but as an object itself.
