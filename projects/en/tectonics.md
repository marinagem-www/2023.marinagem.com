Photos inspired by geomorphology combined with scientific representations. It is very common in scientific studies to use bold colors to highlight components, cells and the structures to be studied. The textures, colors, light treatment and composition affect the notion of scale and origin of the objects. Are these meteors? Scientific photos made in the space? Are they from our universe or are these 3D digital drawings?
