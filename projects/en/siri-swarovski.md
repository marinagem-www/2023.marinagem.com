Siri Swarovski is an installation composed of mirrored acrylic trimmed and headphone adorned with iridescent crystals. The audio is a satirical composition of Siri's responses (virtual assistant) to the theme of happiness interspersed with audience laughter. The statement "you are happy," placed in the corner of the wall puts the viewer in a position of "punishment" and reflection. At first, what was supposed to be funny and joy is turning into decadence.
