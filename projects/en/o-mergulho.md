That is how Pierre Lévy defines virtualisation: “Virtualisation is not a derealisation, but an identity mutation. (…) Virtualisation is one of the main vectors of creating reality.” Like a dive, space-time coordinates in the virtual are wavering, in constant transit. In the water, the human body loses its weight, time has a different speed, we are drawn into a space not defined by the water itself, but by other physical borders (natural or artificial).This work interprets the virtual as a dynamic that is shared with reality, being attentive to its evanescence, mutability and individuality, as a fluctuating moment, assuming it as another way of being present. The blue is commonly associated with water, that is emphasised with the presence of the trampoline.
