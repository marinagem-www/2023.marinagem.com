On a trip to the Amazon Forest during one of the biggest floods, I navigated the waters of a full river. The small boats sailed through the treetops, so much had the river risen. What souls lived in the water and in the canopy at the same time?

Combining this experience with the Parque Augusta in São Paulo - this very important green public space conquered through various mobilizations and popular struggles - the rise of the mechanical platform resembles a big fish tail, allowing the public to discover the layers of the Mata Atlântica, becoming birds themselves. At the same time, the spectators can have a different perspective of the park and its social and environmental importance for the city.
