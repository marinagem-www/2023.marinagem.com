Directly influenced by Richard Serra's list (Verb List Compilation,: Actions to Relate to Oneself / 1967-1968), Mari Nagem selected the Google extensions and turned them into an action. For example, Google Form became "to form", GoogleDrive, turned "to drive" and so on. The verbs were associated and organized according their literal and metaphorical sense, bordering concrete poetry. Google's color standards and typography were used in the prints.
