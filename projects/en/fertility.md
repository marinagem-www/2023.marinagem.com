This work is made of painted brushes installed in a public square. Inspired by the Uruguayan agriculture and the intensive use of GMOs and pesticides it was developed during the Vatel√≥n Residence, in Villa Soriano. This town was the first European settlement in Uruguay and had as current slogan the phrase "Fertile Department".
