{% capture bio %}
Mari Nagem is a conceptual artist working on the perception of digital culture and its relation with nature. Navigating among a variety of media, using luminous colors and sharpened edges, Nagem creates works that enlighten our perception on critical aspects of the information age, such as the artificiality of landscapes, data subjectivity, and the capitalist race for happiness. With wit, and combining appealing titles, she raises existential questions while trying to bring sensibility to our relationship with and through machines.
